# Genuino101
how Genuino101 works, what is its strenght point and an implementation about machine learning library PME

## Presentation
You can check my SlideShare presentation [here](https://www.slideshare.net/FedericoMascoma/genuino101presentation-96832990)

## Project
The project is built using API provided by CuriePME Library.
is implemented the main two pahses for a machine learning program:
1) Training Phase: where the algorithm take data in order to learn different kind of classes
2) Testing Phase: where the algorithm uses what it has learned in order to classify the new instances.

Mainly in the project the training phase consist in draw some letter 8 times each in order to save the value reported by the accellerometer and commit them into a network as training data.
In the testing phase the arduino will knows recognize the letter that you will drawed that are similar to the letter trained before and will does different action based on the letter recognized
