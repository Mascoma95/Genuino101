# Genuino101
how Genuino101 works, what is its strenght point and an implementation about machine learning library PME

## Presentation
You can check my SlideShare presentation [here](https://www.slideshare.net/FedericoMascoma/genuino101presentation-96502280)

## Project
The project is built using API provided by CuriePME Library.
is implemented the main two pahses for a machine learning program:
1) Training Phase: where the algorithm take data in order to learn different kind of classes
2) Testing Phase: where the algorithm uses what it has learned in order to classify the new instances.
